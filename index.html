            As a Customer of Petzz.org, and being the owner of two Boxer puppies, I am extremely satisfied with the care and treatment your organization is giving to my puppies.
            The veterinary doctor is so punctual, caring and very affectionate with the puppies.
            Whenever an emergency visit is required, the doctor visits and attends to the puppies' sickness. 
            So overall, I recommend Petzz.org to a few of my friends having pets in our gated community. 
            Thank you for your excellent service, and keep it up.
